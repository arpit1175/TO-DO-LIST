To Do List____________________

This is a "To Do List" based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Any user can enter task details (i.e. Title and Description) which they have to perform. 
Once the details are entered on the application, the application displays the list of all the tasks to be performed.
When the task is completed, the "Done" button can be clicked to strike-off the task.
There is also an option to remove the task from the list whether it is completed or not.
